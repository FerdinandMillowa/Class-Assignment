This is my Dynamic Web Development module assignment for my second year of college
A simple HTML, CSS website with a little JS here and there for flair and dynamicity(Just enough to pass the assignment)
Will hopefully build on this project in the future when I finish my most pressing issue rn which is the studies and other projects
